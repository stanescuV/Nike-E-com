#E-commerce Website made with React / Node / MSSQL / FireBase

This project is only for trainning purpose, I've been working on it for quite a while and I still have waaaaaay too many things to improve. 

It is a simple website that uses React as the main frontend framework. 

If you want to check the Backend, go and check Nike-Server repo(made with express and mssql)
